# Content

The content on my portfolio showcases the multiple projects and programming I have directly worked on. I regularly work on different projects as part of hackathons, game jams and personal projects, so my portfolio will be updated regularly.

# How was it Made?

My portfolio was made in React. I decided to store my project metadata into an appropriate array within a function module so that I can simply add another project object to the array as and when the next project is available to showcase on my portfolio. This keeps the portfolio easily updateable and keeps it DNRY friendly for elements, as React will handle rendering of the 'new' project component.
